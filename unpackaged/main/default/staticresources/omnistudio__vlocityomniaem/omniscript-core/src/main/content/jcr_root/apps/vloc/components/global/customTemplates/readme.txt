To save more templates, put them in a file in the folder 'templates'.
Multiple templates can be included in a file, and should be enclosed in a script tag with the id set to a specific name and the type to "text/ng-template".

To include templates, add a cq:include tag to customTemplates.jsp with script set to the id of the desired template.

A sample template has been included.

A sample version of customTemplates.jsp has been included and will work if renamed from to remove the 'sample__' that preceeds it.
